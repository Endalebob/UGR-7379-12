              Here I want to describe my overall view of, or attitude toward,
              life and the purpose of life.I believe that my various experiences
              shape and form my philosophies about life, death, the earth, etc.
              Our philosophy is, most of the time, shaped by the philosophical
              thinking of the community in which we live. My attitude toward
              life are built up on the teaching of Bible. Some parts of my
              philosophy are also shaped by the community in which I live.
            </p>

          <p>
            Once, I didn't have a good attitude towards life. I was pessimistic
            about everything, nothing made me happy, and I worried about
            everything. Then my personal relationship with God began to form. My
            view of life started to change from negative to positive. I began to
            see the meaning of life and I found a reason for living happily and
            the reason to have an attitude of gratitude and joy toward life.

                gone. We can't predict or control the future. Our life are

                and heaven that now exist are stored up for fire. This heaven
