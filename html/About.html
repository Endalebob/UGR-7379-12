            I love problem-solving. Whether it is finding the most efficient way
            to write a line of code or figuring out which way is the best fit in
            progression, I love the challenge of finding a way and discovering a
            solution. And I am also interested in learning new technologies, new
            programming languages, and new ways to solve problems.
