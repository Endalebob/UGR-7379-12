              I love problem-solving. Whether it is finding the most efficient way
              to write a line of code or figuring out which way is the best fit in
              progression, I love the challenge of finding a way and discovering a
              solution. And I am also interested in learning new technologies, new
              programming languages, and new ways to solve problems.
