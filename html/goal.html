              I have a plan for my life a to live as God intended. First of all,
              to do anything one must know why he or she does that thing. In
              order to know why he or she does something, they have to know who
              they are. After knowing who they are, they know what to do. After
              knowing who I am, I decided to live as my creator wants me to
              live. My plan is to live a life that glorifies God.

            As a student, my plan is to bring something new that can change the
            life of many people. And contributing my own part to change the
            status of our country.

            Personally, I want to become truly humble and love another. I want
            to help those who need my help. Generally, I have

            <a href="long.html" style="color: #01493c">long-term</a> plans.
